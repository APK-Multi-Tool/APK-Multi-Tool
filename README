APK Multi-Tool

I have updated all the files and modified Apk manager's Scripts to fix many user reported bugs from Daneshm90 apk manager which he had written a simple script to ease the process of editing apks. Got a lot of downloads so thought its in demand

After some thought and after adding new features and decided that since it is no longer just a apk management tool that is is now a multifunctional tool now so I felt to change the name to APK Multi-Tool.

Whether you're doing basic image editing or editing the smali or XML files, on average u have to use (Brut.all or JF's smali/baksmali) awesome tool to extract the apk, edit it, then sign the apk and then adb push/install it. This process is quite tiresome if you are testing a method that needs fine tweaking.

This script should make the process a LOT smoother.
There is an option of compiling/signing/installing all in one step

Thanks:
Goes to Daneshm90 the Original Writer of Apk Manager
Goes to Brut.all for his awesome tool.
Goes to JF for of course, smali/baksmali
Goes to farmatito for porting this script to Linux

FAQs:
- 1. IF Modifying system apps, never resign them unless you want to resign all
- apk's that share its shared:uid
- 2. IF decompiling/recompiling system apps and IF AndroidManifest.xml was not
- preserved from the original apk, then either push the apk when in recovery or
- by doing :
- adb remount
- adb shell stop
- adb push something.apk /wherever/something.apk
- adb shell start
- 3. Decompiling a themed apk is not possible, you must get the original unthemed
- apk, then decompile, make your theme/xml changes and recompile
- 4. IF you're stuck and the log doesnot give you any indication as to what you 
- are doing wrong, then post in the thread http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1310151
- Make sure u include ur APK-Multi-Tool.log, and IF its not a editing problem i.e

What is the Batch Theme Image Transfer TOOL?
This tool makes the process of transferring images from one APK to another APK File of the same file making it easier to update themes or even transferring a theme update.zip of one ROM to another Rom allowing the porting of theme to be much faster.
(Note: You will have to manually replace the progress_horizontal.xml from the framework-res since this file is needed with Theme Changes)
