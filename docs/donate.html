    <p align="center">Since the Creation of APK Multi-Tool There has been Over 5 Million downloads and I have not gotten a single Donation for my hard work as one person.<br/>If everyone who has used my hard work even donated a single Dollar you can do the math but everyone who has used this application and None have donated anything other then two people who I am greatful for there donation which helped pay for some upgrades to equiptment to help server loads and also to updates some software.<br/><br/><br/>Please click the donate buttom below and donate something if you feel to do so as a little will go a long ways and It will help me know and also give me the drive to improve the applicaiton and help out more with investing more time in fixing bugs with the applcation as I Am giving this away free of charge.<br/><br/>There has been countless hours invested into this project and I feel burnt out and <strong>I hate to sound like I Am begging for donations</strong> and<strong> I do not believe that everyone SHOULD DONATE. </strong>I just Feel that a small thank you in Money Form will go a long ways as I need a New <strong>WINDOWS MACHINE</strong> as well as a new<strong> LINUX BOX</strong> for futher Developement as my wife tends to take the laptop to work with her so I Am unable to do much work on the project as I have to talk her into leaving the computer at times so that I can fix bugs as well as repair other issues that are reported.</p>
