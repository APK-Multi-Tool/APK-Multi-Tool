<p>I have updated all the files and modified Apk manager's Scripts to fix many user reported bugs from Daneshm90 apk manager which he had written a simple script to ease the process of editing apks. Got a lot of downloads so thought its in demand  </p>

<p>After some thought and after adding new features and decided that since it is no longer just a apk management tool that is is now a multifunctional tool now so I felt to change the name to APK Multi-Tool.  </p>

<p>Whether you're doing basic image editing or editing the smali or XML files, on average u have to use (Brut.all or JF's smali/baksmali) awesome tool to extract the apk, edit it, then sign the apk and then adb push/install it. This process is quite tiresome if you are testing a method that needs fine tweaking.  </p>

<p>This script should make the process a LOT smoother.<br>
There is an option of compiling/signing/installing all in one step  </p>

<p><strong>Thanks</strong>:  </p>

<p>Goes to Daneshm90 the Original Writer of Apk Manager<br>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>IF Modifying system apps, never resign them unless you want to resign all apk's that share its shared:uid<br>
</li>
<li>IF decompiling/recompiling system apps and IF AndroidManifest.xml was not preserved from the original apk, then either push the apk when in recovery or by doing :<br>

<ul>
<li>adb remount<br>
</li>
<li>adb shell stop<br>
</li>
<li>adb push something.apk /wherever/something.apk<br>
</li>
<li>adb shell start<br>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Decompiling a themed apk is not possible, you must get the original unthemed apk, then decompile, make your theme/xml changes and recompile<br>
</li>
<li>IF you're stuck and the log doesnot give you any indication as to what you are doing wrong, then post in the thread <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1310151">http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1310151</a>

<ul>
<li>Make sure u include ur APK-Multi-Tool.log, and IF its not a editing problem i.e its something regarding when u push it to your phone, then post ur adb log as well.<br>

</li>
</ol>

<p>What is the Batch Theme Image Transfer TOOL?<br>
This tool makes the process of transferring images from one APK to another APK File of the same file making it easier to update themes or even transferring a theme update.zip of one ROM to another Rom allowing the porting of theme to be much faster.<br>
(Note: You will have to manually replace the progress_horizontal.xml from the framework-res since this file is needed with Theme Changes)</p>
